how we can connect multiple microservice to each other:

spring cloud config server


spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri="http"  -- this application is connected to git repository.


Normal application we can connect:


spring config client

spring.config.import=oiptional:configserver:http://localhost:8888

different profile activation:
------------------------------

spring.application.name=limits-service
spring.profile.active=dev

spring.cloud.config.profile=dev



in git :

limits-service-dev.properties


spring-cloud-config -- we can use for fecthing env variables



//  instead of restTemplate we can use feign rest client:

for that we have add below dependies:

spring-cloud-openfeign



and we need to create one inteface and annoated with @feignClient(name="conneting application name")

and that appi we need write

@GetMapping("/currency-exchange/from/{from}/{to}



/// if we want talk multiple applications are talking to each other the we need to configure service registory:


ie called naming server: Eureka naming server


all the application server register with naming server:




previously it was load balancing is Ribbon now its spring cloud load balancing

previously api gateways was zoul now its spring cloud api gateway



resilience --> it is retry when it will get failure happenes
